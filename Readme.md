# What is this?

This is a Jupyter Notebook I made for the course 'Map Projections and Coordinate systems' thought by prof. Frank Canters at Ghent University.

It is a walkthrough of one specific practical course which focuses on the computational study of map projections and the errors of surface, length and angle that are inherently produced when projecting a curved surface on a flat piece of paper.

# How to use it

Download and install [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and open the `reeks4.ipynb` file. To give it a quick try, you could also visit [try.jupyter.org](try.jupyter.org) and open the file there.

The `reeks4.html` file is the HTML output of the notebook. It can readily be opened in a browser. It doesn't have the fancy interactive slider widgets though...
