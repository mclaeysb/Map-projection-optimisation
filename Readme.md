# What is this?

This is a Jupyter Notebook I made for the course 'Map Projections and Coordinate systems' thought by prof. Frank Canters at Ghent University.

It is a walkthrough of one specific practical course which focuses on the computational study of map projections and the errors of surface, length and angle that are inherently produced when projecting a curved surface on a flat piece of paper.

# How to use it

You can just click on the `reeks4.ipynb` file to see and explore the notebook, as GitHub knows how to deal with Jupyter Notebook files. Alternatively, open the `reeks4.html` file, which is the HTML output of the notebook.

Neither of these is 'the real deal' however: Jupyter Notebooks are interactive web applications consisting of cells of text or code, which can be manipulated live. The above are just static outputs of a notebook, so you'll be missing out on the ability to interact with the content (and change the code e.g. to work for other projections) and you'll also be missing out on the fancy interactive slider widgets this notebook uses!

To go all the way, download and install [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and open the `reeks4.ipynb` file. Or, even faster, you could also visit the live-trial website [jupyter.org/try](https://jupyter.org/try) and open the file there.
